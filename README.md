# Examining the neurostructural architecture of intelligence: The Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 Study

## Overview
This repository contains the vertex-wise results from "Examining the neurostructural architecture of intelligence: The Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 Study (LBC1936)". This analysis investigated the relationship between major cognitive domains and cortical volume, measured at 327,684 vertices across the cortical surface in 622 LBC1936 participants (~72.5 years of age) using 13 cognitive tests. Analysis was conducted for both single and bifactor models of general cognitive functioning (g).

## Results
The results are provided in separate files for four cognitive domains and for 'g':
- Processing speed
- Crystallised ability
- Memory
- Visuospatial ability

These files contain t-stats, p-values, and FDR-corrected q-values. 

## Tools Used
The computations were performed using SurfStat, a MATLAB toolbox for the statistical analysis of surface and volumetric data.

SurfStat is available at [https://www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/surfstat/](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/surfstat/).

## Author
These results were computed by Danielle Page and uploaded by Colin Buchanan.
